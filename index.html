            <h2>become a web dev</h2>
            <p>am going to tell you about my strange dream. Yesterday I went to bed and everything was calm. I fell
                asleep and in a moment I appeared in blackness. I called if someone could hear me but no one answered. I
                walked and walked until I saw a light. I went towards it and again I appeared in a forest with the bird
                singing and dancing. I listened to it, but then in a moment all went into flames. A voice screamed so
                loud that I fell down</p>

                <p>Full stack technology refers to the entire depth of a computer system application, and full stack
                    developers straddle two separate web development domains: the front end and the back end. The front
                    end
                    includes
                    everything that a client, or site viewer, can see and interact with.</p>

                <p>A Junior Web Developer works with a team of developers to create new websites and applications. The
                    “junior”
                    designation means you work under the supervision of senior developers in your department, but you
                    may be
                    involved in all stages of the project, from brainstorming to final testing.</p>
